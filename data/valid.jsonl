Now, Peter, perhaps you can tell us something about Green Peace and your job there.\n#Person2#: Sure. Well, I'll start by telling you roughly what Green Peace is all about. I actually work in London for the Green Peace organization. We've been going for a few decades and we're a non-violent, non-political organization.
