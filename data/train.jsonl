After all, anyone can copy and sell it. Really, what is a patent? A piece of paper? A philosophy? You can't see it.\n#Person2#: I am glad you asked that. Actually when an inventor has a patent, it's enforceable by the laws in the country where the inventor developed the invention.

Twenty years is a long time.\n#Person2#: Actually, it does. It's believed that inventors make and sell goods faster after they register the patent because there's a 20-year limitation on the patent.
